abstract: The Back-Projection Algorithm is a SAR processing approach that uses time-domain convolution of the SAR data in order to perform SAR focusing. Some benefits of this approach are exact inversion, ideal motion compensation including topography information and handling of general aperture geometries. The implementation of the Back-Projection Algorithm was done focusing on the parallelization aspects. Applications of the algorithm are presented with respect to topography adaptive processing, direct generation of map projections and consideration of non linear trajectories.
